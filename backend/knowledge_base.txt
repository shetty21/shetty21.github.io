Abhidith's Academic Projects 
1. Flight Status Prediction Using Machine Learning Models Tools/Technologies: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Seaborn) Summary: • Abhidith analyzed a dataset of 4 million flight records from 2022 to classify flights as on-time, delayed, or canceled. • He benchmarked four machine learning models: Random Forest (92% accuracy), Decision Trees (88%), Neural Networks (27%), and Multinomial Naive Bayes (58%). • Abhidith uncovered operational insights, finding that American and Southwest Airlines had the most cancellations and that model performance was affected by data size and class imbalance. • He recommended infrastructure improvements, such as cloud-based scaling and historical data integration, for better trend analysis and prediction accuracy. 
2. Exploring the Association between ICT and Quality of Life: An Empirical Study Tools/Technologies: R (tidyverse, ggplot2), Excel, Tableau, GIS mapping tools Summary: • Abhidith investigated the impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on socioeconomic indicators such as income, employment, and life expectancy across European regions. • He found positive correlations between ICT employment, broadband coverage, and higher incomes/life expectancy, particularly in Western Europe. • Abhidith analyzed digital divides, noting disparities in broadband access and education/training participation, and suggested targeted investments in digital infrastructure and education. • He explored environmental impacts, finding mixed results on the relationship between ICT growth, high-tech trade, and sustainability, and highlighted the need for balanced development policies. 
3. Stellar Classification Using Machine Learning: Classifying Stars, Galaxies, and Quasars Tools/Technologies: Python (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Neural Network), Kaggle & SDSS dataset Summary: • Abhidith developed machine learning models to classify astronomical objects as stars, galaxies, or quasars using spectral data. • He worked with a clean dataset of 100,000 observations and 9 key features (e.g., right ascension, declination, photometric filters, redshift). • Abhidith identified redshift as the most important feature for accurate classification. • He achieved high accuracy with multiple models: Decision Tree (97.54%), Neural Network (96.35%), and Random Forest (97.59%). • Testing Random Forest without redshift led to a drop in accuracy (86.69%), confirming redshift's importance. • Abhidith validated results with multiple train-test splits (60/40, 70/30, 80/20) and a sanity test. • He recommended further feature engineering, applying models to new data releases, and deeper analysis of redshift.
